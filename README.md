# 🗺️ StreetHunt - Urban Exploration Game

## 🏆 Hack Heroes 2025 Submission

### Revolutionizing Urban Mobility Through Gamification

StreetHunt addresses critical challenges facing today's youth: **physical inactivity, social isolation, and declining mental wellbeing** caused by excessive screen time. Our solution transforms urban exploration into an engaging game that naturally encourages outdoor activity and social interaction.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Current Implementation
- **Kotlin / Android Studio** - Primary language and development environment
- **Google Maps API** - Map display and destination points

- **Figma** - UI/UX design and prototyping

### Future Architecture
- **Backend Integration** (Firebase or custom API) for groups, seasons, and data synchronization
- **Cloud Storage** for user progress and social features
- **Real-time Multiplayer** for team challenges

## 🎯 Core Innovation

### Instant Play, Maximum Engagement
